# About me
Hi, I’m Nikolett (**@nixitN**). I’m interested in *HTML+HTML5*, *CSS*, *Python*, *C++* and *C#*. I’m currently learning webdeveloper/webdesign. I will plan to learn the *Python* and *C++/C#* programming language.
My dream is to become a software developer or a game developer. But at the moment I would like to work as a software tester so that I can develop continuously.
- Sometimes I'm a beta tester for [Ubisoft](https://www.ubisoft.com) games.
- As a hobby: I like to read, draw and play video games.
- My strength is the *HTML* and *CSS* languages, I enjoy creating webdesigns / templates.
- My spoken languages are *Hungarian* and *English*.

## My actual 'hidden' projects
- Book Reviewer Template (*hidden*)
- [JavaScript vs. Python](https://github.com/nixitN/js-python)
- Book Generator (*hidden*)

## My finished projects
- [FCC Projects](https://github.com/nixitN/fcc-projects): JavaScript + Python + Responsive WebDesign
